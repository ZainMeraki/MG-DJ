**My Role**

Group member responsible for: 
1) Designing and coding the fully functional, responsive Navigation Bar (ensuring correct links and active state tracking).
2) Designing and coding the complete, responsive Contact Us page, including the contact information section, social media links, and the modal form component.

**Challenges Solved**

The main challenge was creating a complex interactive modal contact form using a CSS-only solution (utilizing the `:target` pseudo-selector and anchor links) for maximum performance without relying on JavaScript. 
Additionally, I ensured the Global Navigation was responsive and maintained the correct active state tracking (`nav-item-active` class) across multiple pages, while balancing component isolation with overall group theme consistency.

**What I Learned**

I successfully implemented CSS-only modal logic by utilizing the `:target` pseudo-selector combined with anchor links to manage the contact form's open/close state without relying on JavaScript. 
I mastered creating a reusable and responsive Global Navigation Bar using Flexbox for consistent site-wide layout. 
Furthermore, I integrated advanced form validation styling (using `:valid`, `:invalid`, and `:not(:placeholder-shown)`) to provide immediate, high-contrast user feedback on required fields.

**What It Does**

A collaborative frontend design project for a multi-page website (MG+), themed around a DJ/event booking platform for scheduling and promotion. 
My focus was delivering two key components: the responsive Global Navigation Bar for site-wide consistency, and the dedicated Contact Us Page, featuring a modern, full-screen CSS-only modal contact form to handle inquiries.
